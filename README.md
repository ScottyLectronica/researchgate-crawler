## 1. About the project

A small script that help me tracking up <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGate</a> paper's references.
Since I often spent enormous amount of time scanning through related references when I'm tracing down a specific 
research topic, this script tries to reduce and make the best use of my time in reading the most valuable references (which is defined as having more citation counts for now). 

## 2. Getting Started

### Download:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kevinyu0506/ResearchGate-Crawler.git
```

### Install Packages:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage:

Users can execute one of the following commands to start crawling.

Option 1. Run from docker hub
```
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output kevinyu0506/researchgate-crawler url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338506484_Less_Is_More_Learning_Highlight_Detection_From_Video_Duration
```

Option 2. Build up a docker image and Run a container from it
```
$ sh crawl.sh https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338506484_Less_Is_More_Learning_Highlight_Detection_From_Video_Duration
```

Option 3. Run by script
```
$ cd src/
$ scrapy runspider spider.py -a url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338506484_Less_Is_More_Learning_Highlight_Detection_From_Video_Duration
```
This will generate an `result.json` file inside `output` directory containing all scraped items, serialized in JSON.

### Output JSON format:

```
